# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN JAVA
This repository is dedicated to my advanced studies and practical explorations in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**. It serves as both a personal learning journal and a public resource for anyone interested in mastering algorithmic problem-solving in Java.

## 🧠 Study Focus

The repository covers a structured progression through fundamental and advanced DSA topics, including:

- **Core Java Foundations**
- **Algorithm Analysis**
- **Recursion and Divide & Conquer**
- **Stacks, Queues, and Deques**
- **Linked Lists and Iterators**
- **Trees and Binary Search Trees**
- **Priority Queues and Heaps**
- **Maps, Hash Tables, and Dictionaries**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Advanced Data Structures**
- **Practical Problem Solving and Complexity Considerations**

Each topic includes:
- Java source code implementations (`.java` files)
- Inline comments and explanations
- Occasional notes, exercises, or complexity analysis

## 💻 Development Environment

- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **IDE / Editor:** [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)  
- **Version Control:** Git  
- **Repository Hosting:** GitHub  

All code is written and managed using Emacs, with Git for version control and synchronization.

## 🚀 Goals

- Strengthen theoretical understanding of data structures and algorithms.  
- Build efficient and reusable Java implementations.  
- Apply algorithmic reasoning to real-world computational problems.  
- Contribute clean, well-documented examples for learners and developers.
